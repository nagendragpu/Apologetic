                        <p class="objection">One common objection is found rooted in the Qur'an. In Surah 4:157 it says '...they neither killer him, nor crucified him, but so it was made to appear to them...'. These 40 arabic words, written in a book that can be dated no earlier than 625 years after the ministry of Jesus and 765 miles away from the place where the events occured (Jerusalem), were written by a man without any firsthand knowledge of the New Testament for it had not yet been translated in the arabic language. These 40 words are clearly not at all reliable and stand at odds with all of the 1st century eye-witness testimony that Jesus died at the hands of Pontius Pilate.</p>

                        <h1>2. The Empty Tomb</h1>
                        <p>Let's look at some good reasons to believe that Jesus' tomb was empty:</p>

                        <ul>
                            <li class="col-md-12 col-xs-12">
                                <p>
                                    The early Jewish response: Ironically, a good line of evidence for the fact of the empty tomb turns out to be provided by his perpetrators. It is recorded in Mat 28:11, that the Jewish authorities bribed the guards to spread a false story that the disciples stole the body of Jesus. Now think about it for a minute, why would you need to say the disciples stole the body if the body was still in the tomb? Their statement already presupposes the empty tomb! And notice Matthew says this story has been widespread among the Jewish community as a response to the resurrection. The earliest Jewish polemic against the Christian propaganda was an attempt to explain away the fact of the empty tomb!
                                </p>
                            </li>
                            <div class="clearfix"></div>
                            <br>

                            <li class="col-md-12 col-xs-12">
                                <p>
                                    Christianity flourishing in the particular location: Christianity began flourishing rapidly in the very same city of Jerusalem where Jesus had been crucified. What we can infer from this is that if the Jews or Romans wanted to find a way to prevent this Christian movement from spreading (which they desperately wanted to do), all they had to do was to publicly display the body of Jesus! Jesus' crucifixion had not occured in a corner, it happened in the public arena very close to the city gate. Everyone knew of this incident and even the tomb's location was well known.

                                            Firstly, women were not identified as credible witnesses in the first century!

                                    <p>Considering this extremely low social status of women and the low value of their testimony in court, why in the world would the authors of the New testament include women in the narrative as the very first eye-witnesses of the risen Jesus!</p>
                                    <p>In fact, if you focus on the narrative, you see that the men were cowardly and hiding in fear of persecution, while the women ran to the tomb. Any person making up this story of the empty tomb would want to be the main character who finds the empty tomb. This important piece falls under the criterion of embarrassment and makes the point ever more reliable.</p>

                        <p>Let's consider two converts: James, the half-brother of Jesus and Paul, the persecutor</p>

                                <p>
                                    Paul was a persecutor of Christians who was ruthless in his killing of christians in the early church (Gal 1:13). He was a religious Jew, filled with zeal, who abhorred the idea of the deity of Christ which caused him to kill the Christians. Yet this same zealous Jew gave up his esteemed leadership among the Jews and acknowledged the deity of Christ after he claimed to have seen Christ on his way to Damascus (where he was going to kill more Christians!), and then became a Christian missionary. He then went on to be used by God to write almost half of the New Testament documents.
                                </p>
                                <p>Paul is believed to have been martyred for his faith. Eusebius, an early church historian, claimed that Paul was beheaded by the Roman emperor Nero.</p>

                                <p>
                                    It is known that James was an unbeliever regarding Jesus being God in the flesh (Mk 3:21, Jn 7:5). Yet something startling happens after Jesus' death which even convinces James that Jesus is God. James went on to become a believer and was even regarded one of the top three leaders of the early church (Gal 2:9)! James also went on to become the sole head of the Jerusalem church and the council of elders (Acts 21:18).
                                </p>
                                <p>From historian Josephus (Antiquities 20.200), we get to know that James was illegally stoned to death for his belief. He was a martyr for Christ.</p>

                        <h1>5. Explosion of Early Christianity</h1>
                        <p>In the first century, there were lots of messainic movements claiming they had found Israel's expected Messiah('Saviour'). When the Romans and Jewish leaders were aware of a movement that seemed to be threatening their authority, they would have that proclaimed 'messiah' killed. The after effects were monotonously the same everytime- the followers would go and find a new 'messiah'. It was radical to claim that the Messiah had been raised from the dead!</p>
                        <p>In fact, the Jews expected a Messiah who would come and set up a political kingdom. On the contrary, Jesus would've been seen as a failure of a Messiah if he was to be considered one because his life ended up with public humiliation of the worst form- curcifixion!.</p>
                        <p>Nevertheless Christianity exploded in the mid first century. Almost all of the original apostles(12) were martyred for their faith. It is baffling to note that Christianity exploded in the face of persecution- in a time here Christians were thrown in gladiator pits to be eaten by lions or dipped in oil and set on fire on the streets for a source of light.</p>

                                        <p>This theory states that the resurrection was made up by the disciples. They lied, the most monumental conspiracy in al of history.</p>

                                            <li>If the disciples lied, then where did the body go? You would be crossing the line of rationality if you think that the disciples- 12 fishermen- managed to fight off the professional Roman guards who protected the tomb of Jesus which was closed off with a 2 tonne stone.</li>
                                            <li>Paul was an enemy of Christ. Why would he lie about the resurrection of Jesus- something he strongly believed was a heresy(false teaching).</li>
                                            <li>Lastly, why would the disples lie? They gained absolutely nothing from this whole thing. On the contrary, almost all of them were martyred for their faith. Christians went through the most horrible persecution in the first few centuries. It's possible for someone to give their life for a lie if they htink it's true. But in this scenario, the disciples would've known it was a lie. It's insane to believe that these disciples gave their lives for a proposition that they knew was a lie.</li>

                                            <li>Clearly this goes against the enormous evidence we have to believe that Jesus died by crucifixion. There are conclusive lines of evidence from history and medical sciences that prove this fact beyond doubt.</li>
                                            <li>Jesus had been so severly beaten by the Roman rulers prior to crucifixion and with all the medical ailments that he would have been plagued with, it would've been impossible for him to revive within 3 days in that time with no specific medical advancement. And if Jesus was severly in a bad condition and appeared to his disciples, rather than convincing them that he was God and had risen from the dead, he would've convinced them that he needed a doctor.</li>

                                            <li>If the disciples merely hallucinated, what happened to the body in the tomb? Why was it empty?</li>
                                            <li>The Postmortem appearances were not individual appearances, rather groups of people together claimed to have seen the risen Jesus. Groups of sizes even around 500! Modern Psychology is accurate in it's remark that group hallucinations are not possible. Hallucinations are an individualistic events like dreams. It would be as absurd as a man telling his wife to dream that they were in Vegas and that he would do the same thereby getting a free holiday to Vegas.</li>
                                            <li>The objector assumes the hallucinations are caused due to the extreme grief of the disciples due to the loss of their dear teacher. But in no wise does this explain Paul's conversion to Christianity. Paul would not be immensely grieved at the death of Jesus, he was an enemy of Christ and his teachings!</li>
