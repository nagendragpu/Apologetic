                        <p> This is based on the simple and well-known law of causality- that every effect has a cause. The famous Latin phrase explains it futher: Ex nihilo nihil fit- Out of nothing, nothing comes. This is not astrophysics or rocket science, this is common sense! </p><br><p>Pop Science theories may have stipulated that some virtual particles come out of nothing but their problem is the incorrect definition of 'nothing'. 'Nothing' is not just a vaccum- absence of matter, but rather 'nothing' is the absence of space itself! It would thereby have no properties whatsoever - including that of extremely-ordered-universe-spawning-properties as well. To belive this would be a leap of faith, indeed this would be irrational faith which is founded contrary to the evidence!</p>

It would be equally likely for Mozart or a Quarter pounder McDonald's burger to spawn out of nothing as well! This assertion seems to make 'nothingness' have attributes such as favouring the spawning of universes and this is absurd because 'nothingness' has <strong>no</strong> attributes!</p>

                    <h1>Philosophical Argument</h1>
                    <p>If the Universe never had a beginning, then we would have to cross an actual infite number of days in the past to reach the present moment/current day. But stipulating that it is possible to come to the present day in a beginningless universe aka 'to cross an actual infinite' is akin to saying it is plausible for Bob to jump out of an infinitely-deep pit! </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>This is not rational at all, just as when you hear Lisa saying she finished counting down all the negative-numbers today as she finally groaned "Zero..". <br>It is not possible to count up to infinity (0,1,2...) and similarily is not possible to count down from infinity (...-2,-1,0). <br>What would you conclude when you scroll to this section of this article and someone tells you that this article had no beginning? You would conclude that it definitely had one since you have reached this present section!</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Hence, since we have reached this present moment, and we know that an infinite regress is impossible i.e it is impossible to cross an actual infinity; reason demands that we conclude that the Universe had a beginning.</p>

                    <h1>Scientific Argument</h1>
                    <p>According to the second law of thermodynamics, unless energy is being fed into a system, that system will become increasingly disorderly. Which means that given enough time, the Universe will run out of useable energy and eventually reach a point of 'heat death' where there will be 'no light, no heat, and no motion'. </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>If the Universe will, in a finite time, reach equilibrium aka 'heat death', and if the Universe is eternal in the past i.e it has no beginning, then it should have reached this state of heat death already. But we are not in this state, hence we know that the Universe had a finite past aka the universe had a beginning. </p>
